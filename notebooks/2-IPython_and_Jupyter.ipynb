When I found out about sys.displayhook, I realized that by putting in a callable object, I would be able to hold state and capture previous results for reuse.  I then wrote a python startup file to provide these features and some other niceties such as loading Numeric and Gnuplot, giving me a 'mini-mathematica' in Python (femto- might be a better description, in fairness).  Thus was my 'ipython-0.0.1' born, a mere 259 lines to be loaded as $PYTYHONSTARTUP.\n",
